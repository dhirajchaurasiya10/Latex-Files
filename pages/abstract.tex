    Sunflower cultivation plays a crucial role in global agriculture, but its productivity is often threatened by various diseases. Early and accurate disease identification is essential for timely intervention and yield preservation. This project proposes a hybrid deep learning architecture combining Inception-V2 and U-Net models to address the challenges of sunflower disease identification. Inception-V2, a convolutional neural network (CNN) known for its efficiency in feature extraction, is employed to classify sunflower diseases based on leaf images. U-Net, a specialized CNN architecture for image segmentation, is integrated to refine disease localization within the leaf. The proposed architecture leverages the strengths of both models, aiming to improve the accuracy and robustness of disease identification. A comprehensive dataset of sunflower leaf images, encompassing various diseases and healthy leaves, is used to train and evaluate the hybrid model. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the hybrid architecture in accurately classifying and localizing sunflower diseases, offering a promising solution for automated disease monitoring and management in sunflower cultivation.
